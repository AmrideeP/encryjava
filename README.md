# encryjava
A microproject on demonstration of Synchronous key encryption using JAVA. The code is plug and play compliant 
i.e you can copy and paste the source code to see how it works.

You can read more about synchronous key encryption here -->

The algorithm developed in this code is completely my own and I have not copied it from any other source.

Thank you
